#bioinformatics_tools

This repository contains scripts and programs designed for general use on bioinformatics data sets.

###get_genic_intergenic_counts.py
----------------------------------
This script takes in BED format locations of intergenic and genic regions along with a BAM file and counts the number of reads that overlap these regions.  BED files for hg19 genomes of genic and intergenic regions have been supplied to help the user in case, intergenic regions files have not yet been generated by the user.
